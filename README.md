#### Railroader Mod
# T-cave's Cottonworks
#### carve-out by Leif_The_Head

This is the Cottonworks industry at the east yard lead of Bryson, isolated as standalone mod.

This version has added compability for [PrinceOfPluto's Hump Yard](https://www.nexusmods.com/railroader/mods/120/) which starts off the same place. This compability alters the hump and runaround track to fit around the cottonworks entry.

Also compatible with [Leif's Bryson East Yard](https://github.com/Leif-The-Head/RR-Bryson-East-Yard/), which branches off at the upper end of the cottonworks entry. (Obviously not compatible to the other yard above)

## Installation
This is a [Railloader Mod](https://railroader.stelltis.ch/), and as such requires Railloader itself and follows the standard Railloader installation way.

### Requirements
- [Zamu's Strange Customs](https://railroader.stelltis.ch/mods/strange-customs)
- [AlinaNova's MapMod](https://railroader.alinanova.dev/) (progressions)

### Conflicts
- T-cave's Machining and Manufacturing (duh)
