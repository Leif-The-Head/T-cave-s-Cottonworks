#### Railroader Mod
# T-cave's Cottonworks
#### carve-out by Leif_The_Head

This is the Cottonworks industry at the east yard lead of Bryson, isolated as standalone mod.

This version has added compability for PrinceOfPluto's Hump Yard which starts off the same place. This compability alters the hump and runaround track to fit around the cottonworks entry.
Also compatible with Leif's Bryson East Yard, which branches off at the upper end of the cottonworks entry. (Obviously not compatible to the other yard above)

### Installation / Requirements
This is a Railloader Mod, and as such requires Railloader itself.
Also required:
- Zamu's Strange Customs
- AlinaNova's MapMod (progressions)
- NickB's Standard Catalog of LoadIDs (loads)
- T-cave's MOW workmen (workmen car for progression)

### Conflicts
- T-cave's Machining and Manufacturing (duh)
